# 5G-Masterclass

## **Introduction to 5G**
* The next decade will be empowered by the capabilities of 5G technology.
* 5G enables three major categories of communication:
    1.  **Next-Level Wireless Broadband Experience:** Enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB).
    2.  **Massive Machine Type Communication (mMTC):** Allows for the deployment of a huge number of devices (e.g., IoT sensors).
    3.  **Ultra-Reliable Low-Latency Communication (URLLC):** Provides very high performance for critical applications (e.g., remote surgery, autonomous vehicles).

#### **Course Focus & Content**
* This course will explore the concepts that make up the **5G Radio Access Network (RAN)**.
* Key topics to be covered include:
    * Innovative features of 5G RAN.
    * Protocols used in the network.
    * Key procedures that make the network function.
* Understanding these functionalities is key to enabling the different use cases of 5G.

#### **Target Audience**
* Telecom Professionals who want to learn about the 5G RAN.
* Students who are interested in joining the telecommunications industry.

#### **Prerequisites**
* A basic understanding of the principles of networks.
* A basic understanding of wireless communications.

#### **Learning Outcomes & Course Structure**
* At the end of the course, you will be able to work with advanced concepts that are part of the 5G RAN.
* The course is structured to make complex ideas simple to understand, using visual illustrations where necessary.
